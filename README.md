A simulation of RWA for IPoWDM optical backbone networks by Konstantinos Delistavrou.

Direct Bypass is the implementation of the power efficient algorithm by Shen & Tucker that does not apply traffic grooming and serves traffic in a single queue.

Multi-hop Bypass is the implementation of the power efficient algorithm by Shen & Tucker that applies traffic grooming and serves traffic in a single queue.

Hybrid bypass is a new algorithm that examines power efficiency in compination with low latency and uses two queues for serving traffic.
