The file "_open-this_Alg_HybridBypass_Net-Shen_Tucker_b_N14L21_X-40.html" has the output of the simulator.

It's better to download the folder and open the above file.

The lightbase has the results of the current run/repetition of the experiment encoded in DB format (SQLite).

I intend to integrate everything into an application with a single working environment on first opportunity of free time.

Enjoy!
